I really like anime. When I saw other people's self-made anime show which is gathering different fragments of anime together and accompanying with self-favorite music and subtitles, I really feel like I want to do this. Then I found the biggest surprise of Mac. One of its video apps named iMovie really impressed me and makes everything so easy and entertaining.

After I finished my video, I found the song I used is a Japanese song. Although I can generally understand, it's meaningless if others who see my video don't get it. In this case, I found a free app which can help me edit stylish pretty subtitles named Aegisub.

Aegisub can only help you make a subtitle file which is separated from the video, so you need to embed your subtitle to your video. I used XviD4PSP for burning the subtitles to my video.

This is the video I made and uploaded to Youtube: [www.youtube/xUvjtHbZAYg](https://youtu.be/xUvjtHbZAYg)

In summary, you need three essential apps for making videos.
* iMovie for film and audio editing
* Aegisub for subtitles (I used it in Windows cos it has some problem with Chinese characters. If you want to do English subtitle, go for the Mac version)

  Here is where you can download it: [www.aegisub.org/](http://www.aegisub.org/)
* XviD4PSP for adding your subtitles to your video(This one only have Windows version, but you can use [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) instead)

  Here is the link for XviD4PSP: [www.bit.ly/Xvid4PSP](http://bit.ly/Xvid4PSP)

iMovie	
=========
The steps to use it:
* Create a new Event in your library and a new blank movie inside that event.
* In the movie you created, import the videos you want to edit. Cut the part you like and add it to your own movie.You can use the Title, Transaction, or Audit options on the left sidebar to help you beautify your video.
* After you finish everything, click Share on the right of tool bar on the top.(I always choose file in case I need to add
	subtitles)

Simple video for you to start iMovie:
<video width="300" height="200" controls>

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Aegisub
=========
The steps to create the subtitles for any show:
   * Open a video and text editor at the same time. Listen to the video, translate it sentence by sentence till the end of the video. Save it as a .txt file after you finish it.
   * Open the Aegisub, import your .txt file you just translated. Then open the video, go the audio window, and find certain time interval for each sentence you just translated.

Useful Shortcut Keys:
```
* S: Play the part from the start line to the end line.
* A: Move back the whole audio.
* D: Play the part close to the end line.
* F: Move forward the whole audio.
* G: Set this interval for this sentence.
```
   * Once you have done editing subtitles, save your subtitle file. If you want to burn the subtitle to your video, just save it as .ass file then it will keep all the styles like font, position or color you edited in Aegisub. However, I know some people just want to upload the video directly to the Youtube with subtitle addicted, then export the subtitle as .srt or some formats else which can be accepted by Youtube.


XviD4PSP
===========
It's super easy to burn your subtitles to the videos. Open XviD4PSP, choose Open to open the video, choose Add to add subtitle files, pick the format of output and hit the Encode.
